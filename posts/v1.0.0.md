# Fastro v1.0.0: High Performance by Design

We are thrilled to announce the release of Fastro v1.0.0. This version
represents a significant milestone in our quest to build the fastest, most
developer-friendly web framework for Deno.

Starting with v1.0.0, Fastro shifts to a robust **class-based architecture**
while maintaining its ultra-lean core. This version is the result of a total
revamp and a unique collaboration with **Gemini AI**, ensuring every line of
code is optimized for both humans and machines.

## Performance: ~77,600 Requests/sec

The primary goal of Fastro is to provide a high-level API without the "framework
tax." Our latest benchmarks show that Fastro maintains over **94.8%** of native
`Deno.serve` performance, reaching **77,654 requests per second** with an
average latency of only **1.21ms**. We achieved this through several key
technical decisions:

### 1. Zero-Dependency Core & 100% Coverage

Fastro is built strictly on Deno standards. By avoiding a heavy tree of external
dependencies, we keep the startup time near-instant and the runtime overhead
minimal. This release also marks a milestone in stability: **100% test
coverage** across the entire core.

### 2. Intelligent LRU Caching

Routing is often the bottleneck in web frameworks. Fastro uses an intelligent
**Least Recently Used (LRU)** cache for route matching. Once a URL is matched to
a route pattern, the Result is cached. Subsquent requests to the same path skip
expensive regex executions entirely.

### 3. Lazy Parsing

We don't parse what you don't use. Objects like `ctx.url` and `ctx.query` are
lazy-loaded getters. If your handler doesn't touch the query parameters, Fastro
never spends cycles parsing the search string.

## Developer Experience: Class-Based API

In response to community feedback, v1.0.0 introduces a familiar class-based
constructor:

```ts
import Fastro from "https://deno.land/x/fastro/mod.ts";

const app = new Fastro();

app.get("/", () => "Hello World");

await app.serve();
```

This pattern provides better IDE discoverability and allows for multiple
isolated server instances within the same process.

## Built for Scale

Fastro isn't just for "Hello World" apps. We've included advanced features for
large-scale applications:

- **Modular Routing**: Group routes using `createRouter()` and mount them as
  middleware.
- **Automatic Module Loading**: Turn your folder structure into an application
  automatically with `autoRegisterModules`.
- **Flexible Context**: A unified `ctx` object that flows through middleware,
  allowing for clean state management.

## What's Next?

We are just getting started. v1.0.0 is our stable foundation. In the coming
months, we'll be focusing on expanding our built-in middleware ecosystem and
improving our documentation and tutorials.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to the journey!
