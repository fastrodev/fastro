# ⚡ Fastro Framework

### **The Ultra-Fast, Minimalist Web Framework for Deno.**

Fastro bridges the gap between raw Deno performance and elite developer
experience. Built for speed, security, and simplicity, it features a robust
middleware engine, intelligent LRU caching, and a zero-boilerplate API.

## 🚀 Why Fastro?

- **🏎️ Maximum Throughput**: Benchmark-proven to maintain **>95% of raw Deno
  performance**. Stop choosing between DX and speed.
- **✨ Intuitive API**: Return `string`, `JSON`, or `Response` directly. No more
  `.send()` or `.json()` boilerplate.
- **📦 Lean & Secure**: Zero external dependencies. Built strictly on top-tier
  Deno standards.
- **🏗️ Organized Scaling**: Advanced directory-based module loading keeps your
  project clean as you grow.
- **🛡️ Rock-Solid Core**: 100% test coverage and first-class TypeScript support
  ensure your app stays stable.

  middleware with an async/await flow you already know.
- **📂 Auto-Loading Modules**: Register entire directories of functionality with
  a single command.
- **🔒 Type-Safe by Default**: Enjoy deep IDE integration and compile-time
  safety.
- **📊 Benchmark-First**: Built-in verification tools to ensure your app stays

## 🏁 Quick Start

Build and serve your first app in seconds:

```ts
import app from "./mod.ts";

// Simple string response
app.get("/", () => "Welcome to Fastro!");

// Automatic JSON serialization
app.get("/user/:id", async (req, ctx) => {
  return { id: ctx.params.id, status: "active" };
});

// Powerful, predictable middleware
app.use((req, ctx, next) => {
  ctx.startTime = Date.now();
  return next();
});

await app.serve({ port: 8000 });
```

## 📊 Performance That Matters

Don't take our word for it. Benchmarks conducted using **Grafana k6** (100 VUs,
10s):

| Metric                  | Native Deno   | Fastro Framework  |
| :---------------------- | :------------ | :---------------- |
| **Requests per Second** | ~76,000 req/s | **~72,800 req/s** |
| **Average Latency**     | 1.23 ms       | **1.29 ms**       |
| **95th Percentile**     | 2.37 ms       | **2.29 ms**       |

> _"Fastro provides a complete developer-friendly abstraction without
> sacrificing the performance advantages of Deno."_
