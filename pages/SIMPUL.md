**Simpul** flips the marketplace script. Instead of buyers searching for products, we empower sellers to actively "hunt" for real-time buyer needs.

### ⚡ The Concept

* **Buyers** broadcast a "Need" (e.g., "I need 50 lunch boxes today").
* **Vendors** receive instant notifications and use **Opportunity Credits** to unlock the lead and send a proposal.
* **Organisations** get a premium SaaS tier for procurement, including RBAC and automated invoicing.

### 🚀 Key Features

* **Reverse Dynamics:** Sellers find buyers, reducing marketing waste.
* **0% Commission:** We monetize the connection, not the transaction.
* **Enterprise-Ready:** Multi-tenant architecture with professional procurement workflows.

### 🛠 Tech Stack

Built on **Fastro**, a high-performance web framework created and maintained by the founder, ensuring ultra-low latency and massive scalability.

### 💰 Business Model

1. **Vendor Credits:** Pay-per-connection to high-intent leads.
2. **Corporate SaaS:** Monthly subscription for advanced management tools.
